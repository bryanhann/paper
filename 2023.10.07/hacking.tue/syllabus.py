# area of triangle.
# formula = (base * hight) / 2

# Suppose base is 10 and height is 6
# What is area?
# Area is (10*6)/2, which is 30.
# Let python calculate it.
# >>> (10*6)/2
# 30.0
# This expression works, but it is not
# reusable. Try this:
# >>> base=10
# >>> height=6
# >>> (base*height)/2
30.0
# Now we can change the values of base
# and height.
# >>> base=4
# >>> height=20
# >>> (base*height)/2
# 40.0
# # we know we can combine lines, so:
# >>> base=4 ; height=20; (base*height)/2
